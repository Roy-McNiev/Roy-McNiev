Hey. This is ***Roy McNiev***. Congratulations that you've found this space.

During the speeding pace of life, people are spending more time focusing about the present and less about else: the history and the future. This, seemingly positive and beneficial emphasizing effectiveness and life quality, plus a good mood, will however result in reduction of us thinking deeply beyond what we are aware of.

No matter if it is coding, or just scratches of short pieces, I hope to bring the people around me something more and different, because we are all thriving for a better tomorrow...
